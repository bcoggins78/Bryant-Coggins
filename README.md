# Updated Portfolio

### UNC Coding Bootcamp Week 9 Homework Project



**[https://bcoggins78.github.io/Bryant-Coggins/](https://bcoggins78.github.io/Bryant-Coggins/)**

This weeks homework assignment had us revisit and update our Portfolio page.  I opted to recreate it from scratch.  When creating the page, I wanted to keep it simple but to also show off some of the things I've learned in the last couple of months.  The site is mobile responsive with some simple CSS animations thrown in.  I'm also utilizing Firebase to store comments submitted from the contact page.  New links have been added to my resume and to my Linked In and Github profiles.


This project was built with:

* HTML 
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* Firebase
